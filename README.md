Key Features ----> 
1. Project Plannining : The goal of a serverless web application on AWS is to provide a scalable, cost-effective, and efficient solution for hosting and running web applications without the need to manage server infrastructure and for this project initialy I was ready for AWS IAM , AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway,Amazon DynamoDB , Amazon S3 , AWS CloudFormation , AWS CloudWatch.

2.. Architecture Design: Design the overall architecture of your serverless application.
Determine which AWS services will be used for different components of the application.
Consider factors like scalability, security, and performance.

3. Environment Setup: Environement Setup means Setup an AWS Account and next Configure IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles with appropriate permissions.
and I Install any necessary development tools and SDKs.

4. Frontend Development:
Develop the user interface (UI) of your web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular.
Implement client-side logic for user interactions and data presentation.

5. Backend Development: 
Design and implement the backend logic of your application using serverless functions.
Write serverless functions using AWS Lambda, which will serve as the backend code for handling requests and business logic.
Set up API endpoints using Amazon API Gateway to trigger Lambda functions.

6. Data Management: Set up and configure databases services like Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon S3

7. Authentication and Authorization:
Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure your application.
Use AWS Cognito or other authentication services to manage user identities and access control.

8.Monitoring and Maintainance : Use AWS CloudWatch or other monitoring services to monitor metrics, set up alarms, and troubleshoot issues.Serverless web application developed on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform Key Features ----> 1.
